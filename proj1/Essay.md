Application Tracking System
BurnOut-2.0
Classmate Bot
SRIJAs-2.0
Track My Dollar 

In the process of executing this project, we understood the importance of “Crafting Code that Ages Gracefully: Where Maintenance Reigns Supreme!”. As we started going through all 5 projects and their demo videos, we understood the significance of documentation and of a video that clearly demonstrates each functionality of the application.

We started with exploring the project titled ‘BurnOut2.0’, as we liked the idea of the project, but we faced difficulties in understanding the flow of the code. We attempted to get a clear picture of functionalities through the documentation but even that didn’t turn out well. We identified some undocumented technologies.  Furthermore, we couldn't discover either the structure of individual tables or the Entity Relationship diagrams for the database they have  used. We were unable to proceed further with the execution due to the issues mentioned earlier, thus we shifted to a different project.

The next project we started is titled ‘ClassmateBot’. On start we observed that commands which are loaded directly into the discord bot are working fine but all those commands which are included in the cogs folder were not properly getting loaded into the discord bot. We skimmed through the documentation for further information and realized that the modules used in the project ‘discord.py’ are probably of a different version from the ones that are available now. To make the modules execute properly we were required to match the versions that were used in the previous project. Additionally, the comments provided in the code snippets were not enough for full understanding of the respective functionalities. Thereafter we moved to another project.

The next one we picked up is titled “Application Tracking System”. We understood the gist of the project and felt that this application can be widely used by students and job seekers. As the documentation of Application Tracking System is comprehensive and quite understandable, we followed the installation process, however we got stuck in the execution due to version mismatches of various technologies and code complexity.

Moving on to the next one: SRIJAs (Smart-Resume-Interpreter-And-Job-Alert-System). We started with the project documentation which was not elaborative enough to give a clear picture of the whole project. As a result, we ended up moving to a different one.
While working on the "MyDollorBot" our experiences differed in several ways. One of the nice elements we discovered when observing the project was the setup step. The documentation included steps for configuring the environment, making it simple for individuals who are unfamiliar with the technological stack to get started without any problems.  

Even though the setup procedure was straightforward, we had trouble in understanding several features because there were no comments in the code. Because of this omission, tracing certain features was a little more challenging. Since all the files in which code was created were gathered into a single folder, navigating through the code base was another difficult aspect. To deal with these challenges, we tried to integrate relevant functionalities together, which provided us with a better perspective and made the process simpler.

These experiences taught us how crucial it is to keep any project's code updated and well-documented. In project-2, besides code documentation, we will also consider documenting other aspects of the project, such as system architecture, API documentation, and deployment procedures. This comprehensive documentation can be valuable to both current and future developers. 

We would also incorporate easily understandable comments wherever necessary and maintain the code from time to time so that the future users would not face the issues with the versions we have used. We would also maintain consistent code formatting such as naming conventions, indentation rules, which makes it easier for team members to understand and contribute to the codebase.We would definitely use version control systems like Git to track changes, collaborate with team members, and easily revert the changes if issues arise, which would help us have a history of our codebase and manage updates effectively.
We would also conduct regular code reviews among team members to ensure code quality, to identify potential issues, and to share knowledge. Additionally, we would  compile a list of common human errors along with strategies to mitigate them.

On trying various functionalities of “MY Dollar Bot ”, we felt that there is scope for improvements in some of the functionalities that are already implemented. This is one of the reasons for choosing this project. There were issues during the implementation phase and when referred to the documentation regarding these issues, we couldn’t find anything related to the errors. Hence, we will ensure that there will be documentation that includes what errors might occur during the implementation phase. 

We will provide multiple contact details of the project creators to assist users and future developers for any further queries. We feel that the most helpful resource for a developer to understand the workflow is, the video of code execution. We’ll try to ensure that each and every test case is executed and recorded for future references. We are planning to add some more functionalities and visualizations for a simpler user interface.
